## Health Connect. Privacy policy

This is an open source Android app developed by Konstantin VERNER. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the user is stored on the user's device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.


The application requests a variety of permissions to access and manage health-related data and external storage. These permissions include reading and writing heart rate, steps, speed, sleep, exercise, total calories burned, weight, distance, and nutrition data. Specifically, permissions for reading and writing heart rate, steps, speed, sleep, exercise, total calories burned, weight, distance, and nutrition data are required to enable the app to comprehensively track and update the user's health metrics. Additionally, the app requests permissions to read and write to external storage up to Android SDK version 32, allowing it to manage files and data stored on the user's device. The app also requires internet access to enable connectivity and data synchronization.

The full list of required permissions can be found in the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/konverner/healthgateway/blob/main/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)

Sincerely,<br>
Konstantin VERNER<br>
